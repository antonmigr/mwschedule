Things still to do:
most important:

-increase cell height in admin page
-events overlap

less important:
-add 30 mins to every new patient slot and subtract 30 too
-add type checkboxes for new slots on the admin page
-adjacent slots should be morphed into one in the client page
-when user clicks on a slot before today's date, it still asks
them if they want to book
